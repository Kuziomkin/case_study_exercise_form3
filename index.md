# Introduction
This document outlines the business, stakeholder, and solution requirements, as well as the assumptions and risks, for the account funding via PayPal feature. It is intended for product managers, developers, quality assurance specialists, and other stakeholders.

# Objective and solution concept
This section describes business requirements, success metrics and assumptions.
## Context
LHV Pank, our customer, aims to increase monthly user activity. They have identified that some of their users utilize the PayPal system in both their business and personal lives. As a result, LHV Pank wants to offer the option for users to fund their bank accounts via PayPal without incurring any commission.
## Business opportunity
Form3 can differentiate itself on the market by offering PayPal payment services as a separate product on its Payment Platform, accessible through a single API. This could give Form3 a competitive advantage.
## Success metrics
Within six months of implementation, ten percent of Form3 customers subscribed to the PayPal service through the Payment Platform.
## Assumptions
- Customers will be interested in using the PayPal service through the Payment Platform.
- The PayPal service will be easy for customers to use and understand.
- Customers will trust the PayPal service and feel confident using it to fund their bank accounts.
- The Payment Platform will be able to handle the additional traffic and workload generated by the PayPal service.
- The PayPal service will be available and reliable during the implementation period.
- The integration of the PayPal service into the Payment Platform will be successful and will not cause any disruptions or issues.
## Limitations
- The System must provide PayPal money transfer service via single Form3 API.
